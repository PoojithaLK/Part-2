# Part-2

This part is all about JunitTesting where we test the methods of a java class using different inputs with positive and negative test cases.
Here squareTeat.java file is testing the square method in the JunitTesting.java file and compares it with a assert value we pass in the code.
Same way divideTest.java file tests the divide method in the JunitTesting.java file and compares it with a assert value we pass in the code.
